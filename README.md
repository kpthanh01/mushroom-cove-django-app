## Description
Mushroom Cove is a website to educate and inform users about the world of mushroom. More specifically, it's core feature is for users to create their own mushroom catalog. For each mushroom they decide to add to their catalog, they can also make a track record for those specific mushrooms. Joting down information such as 'Notes', 'Location', and 'Date' for when they encounter/forage these mushrooms. Mushroom cove is a place for enthusiast to learn about mushrooms, and a great place to start any interest in these amazing species.

## Next Steps
Moving onward, my next goals would be to:
- include a filtering system for mushroom if the data becomes large
- A more complete mushroom encyclopedia where users can apply a particular mushroom to their catalog instead of making one from scratch
- Be able to delete previously log mushrooms
